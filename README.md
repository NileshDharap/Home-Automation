# Home-Automation
- In this project we are using 8051 controller to turn off the load based on user defined time (in secs). Keypad Interfacing, LCD interfacing, Serial Communication and Relay are major blocks.
- I have uploaded Proteus simulation and asm code.
- We can give the input time either by keypad or serial communication.It is designed to get input of 3 digits.
- For keypad interfacing , after selecting 3 digits press '#' to further proceed the simulation.
